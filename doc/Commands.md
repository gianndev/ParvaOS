## **Instructions for use üìñ**

ParvaOS is an operating system with a GUI: it has a terminal through which you can give commands to the system and get output.

By default the window on the screen is still. To enter "move mode" press the tab key and use the WASD keys to move the window. Once you are finished you can press the Esc key to return to normal mode where the window does not move. Pressing SPACE you can toggle fullscreen mode, and pressing SPACE another time you can make the window small again.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You NEED to type `install` in order to format the file with the ParvaFS file system (you can just run it the first time, not every time you start the OS). Otherwise, if you do not run this command the OS will continue to work but you won't be able to save files on the disk.

NOTE: For now the only window available is the Terminal
